# Counterspell Portal

**Counterspell Portal** is a work-in-progress way to connect [Counterspell](https://counterspell.hackclub.com/) events together. Counterspell is a game jam being run in 200+ cities simultaneously, and this project takes advantage of that by connecting events in real time. Counterspell Portal facilitates a live video feed between random events, shuffling every 15 minutes.

This project was partially inspired by the [NYC-Dublin Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%E2%80%93Dublin_Portal), an art installation from March 2024 (though we're hoping for less controversy!)
