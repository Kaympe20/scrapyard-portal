# Counterspell Portal

**Counterspell Portal** is a work-in-progress way to connect [Counterspell](https://counterspell.hackclub.com/) events together. It facilitates a live video feed between random events, shuffling every 15 minutes. Counterspell Portal is powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/).

Counterspell Portal was partially inspired by the [NYC-Dublin Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%E2%80%93Dublin_Portal), an art installation from March 2024 (though we're hoping for less controversy!)
